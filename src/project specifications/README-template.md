## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size
- Perform mathmatical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Adjust the color theme based on their preference
- **Bonus**: Have their initial theme preference checked using `prefers-color-scheme` and have any additional changes saved in the browser

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Compound Components
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I decided to use React for this project because i wanted to get more practice with the library and because i thougth i would be easier to handle the theme change with it. Some of the new things i learned were that i can use input as a display with the read-only properti but at the end decided to use a <div> element because it was easier, i also learned how i can save state in local storage to use it to keep changes made to the site. This is the first project in wich i applied Theme provider and i was blown by how practical and useful it is because we can pass properties through the theme prop and use them in styled components. I will definitely use it again.
